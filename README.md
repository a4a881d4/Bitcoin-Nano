What is Bitcoin Nano?
============================
Bitcoin Nano (BTN) is a fork of Bitcoin. We will take a block chain snapshot at block 500553, and a cryptocurrency will be generated, Bitcoin Nano(BTN). Bitcoin Nano applies a PoW algorithm, Equihash, which Can effectively prevent the ASIC mining. We expect more people to take participate in the Bitcoin Nano project make it better.


What is the purpose of Bitcoin Nano?
=======================================
The purpose of Bitcoin Nano is to give Bitcoin a wider range of applications, such as online games, live video, etc. We will implement the Smart contracts via the side-chain technology, compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Everybody can issue tokens on the side chains and make the exchange between coins/tokens and Bitcoin Nano. All these things enable them to convert the values between multiple-domain and multiple-application scenarios. 
First of all, we will work with some video live platforms. The audience can make their thumbs up to their favorite videos with BTNs. Meanwhile, the BTNs will be applied to the game field. You can buy props with tokens, or make BTN as the certificate for adopting cryptopets. Moreover, due to the popular of Crypto kitties, it has resulted in a serious network congestion, so that a large number of transactions cannot be confirmed. In order to solve this problem, Bitcoin Nano will isolate different scenarios through side-chain technology and make it runs more effectively.


How can I get Bitcoin Nano?
===============================
Anyone who held Bitcoin when block 500553 was mined automatically received Bitcoin Nano at the rate of 1 BTC = 1000 BTN (If you had 99 BTC at the time of the fork, you now also have 99000 BTN). If your Bitcoins are stored by a third party such as an exchange, then you must inquire with them about your Bitcoin Nano . Of course, you can get BTN via buying or mining.



Bitcoin Nano (BTN)â€™4 FEATURES
=====================================
BTN has 4 features as following:Mining Algorithm, block size,smart contact and cross-chaining trading.
Mining Algorithm:By inserting the side chain, we will integrate the smart contract's feature and compatible with the current ethernet virtual machine (EVM), to allow our users develop distributed applications via side chains (Dapp), and publish smart contracts.
Block Size:For the sake of low fees and fast confirmations, we will raise the limitation of it into 8 MB. According to current implementation and experimentation, 8MB block size is enough to meet all the transactions now.
Smart Contact: By inserting the side chain, we will integrate the smart contract's feature and compatible with the current ethernet virtual machine (EVM), to allow our users develop distributed applications via side chains (Dapp), and publish smart contracts.
Cross-chain Trading: For the sake of low fees and fast confirmations, we will raise the limitation of it into 8 MB. According to current implementation and experimentation, 8MB block size is enough to meet all the transactions now.
